# Optimizing Material Selection for Web Rendering

In large 3D models an often overlooked aspect of memory and computational usage is the material of the 3D object. GPU `shaders` are basic functions that rely on this information and determine how light is reflected / scattered / absorbed by the surface of the object. If not optimized, this can lead to bottlenecks in GPU usage. This paper provides a quick analysis of the basics of material selection in 3D models.
