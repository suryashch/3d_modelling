# 3d_modelling
A repo where I explore how 3D modelling works.

## Getting started

[Here is a link](https://github.com/suryashch/3d_modelling/blob/main/reducing-mesh-density/analysis_mean-pooling-on-mesh.md) to where I apply a `Pooling` Function on a set of vertices in a 3D model.

[Here is a link](https://github.com/suryashch/3d_modelling/blob/main/reducing-mesh-density/analysis_decimate.md) to reduce the mesh density of objects in Blender.

[Here is a link](https://github.com/suryashch/3d_modelling/blob/main/hosting-3d-model/analysis_superposing-models.md) to where I explore superposing mutliple versions of the same 3D model in a JavaScipt scene, and dynamically switching between them based on how far away to user is.

[Here is a link](https://github.com/suryashch/3d_modelling/blob/main/hosting-3d-model/analysis_threejs.md) to where I explore how to host a 3D model on a webpage using `three.js`
