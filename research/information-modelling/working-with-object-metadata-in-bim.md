# Working With Object Metadata in BIM Models

A fundamental data point that drives Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the object metadata. These data serve as the link between the digital and the physical, and helps identify the objects in the field. For example, we have spoken extensively about piping in the model. Object metadata provides us with further information about this pipe- what type of fluid is running through it? What is it's pipeline ID? How long is the pipe? What is the diameter? All these questions are answered through object metadata.

In this paper, we explore the basics of IFC (Industry Foundation Class), as standard for metadata in construction, as well as how best to create, edit, and store this metadata in the model.
